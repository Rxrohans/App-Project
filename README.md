## 📌 Project Overview

This application was developed as part of my Clinical Project during the M.Tech Clinical Engineering program at CMC Vellore. The goal was to assist physiotherapists and clinicians in monitoring patient symptoms related to chronic low back pain.

The mobile app allows patients to self-report pain levels at different times of day, along with factors such as sleep quality, physical activity, and medication intake. The data is collected using a simple survey interface and stored securely for clinical review.

## 🎯 Objectives

- To enable self-reporting of low back pain symptoms across time (morning, afternoon, evening).
- To correlate symptom variation with influencing factors such as:
  - Sleep quality
  - Medication adherence
  - Physical activity
- To deploy the app for clinical pilot testing.
- To support clinicians with trend analysis and data visualization.
